# Prototipo-Scan

## Project Overview
This is a GitHub import of the Prototipo-Scan repository. The repository contains only a README file with no source code or application logic.

## Current State
- **Date imported**: November 27, 2025
- **Repository contents**: README.md only
- **Status**: Empty project - no application code to run

## Project Structure
The repository appears to be either:
1. A placeholder for a future scanning prototype application
2. A newly initialized repository without code yet
3. An incomplete clone

## Next Steps
To make this a functional project, you would need to:
1. Define what kind of scanning application this should be (document scanner, QR code scanner, barcode scanner, etc.)
2. Choose a technology stack (web app, mobile app, desktop app)
3. Implement the core functionality
4. Add dependencies and build configuration

## Notes
- No workflows configured (no code to run)
- No dependencies installed (no package files found)
- No database required (no application logic)
